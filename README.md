# SQL-Task4- Aggregate Functions and Grouping

This repository contains the SQL script for **Task 4** of the SQL Developer Internship program.

The objective of this task is to demonstrate the use of SQL aggregate functions and grouping techniques to summarize and analyze tabular data.

---

## Concepts Covered

- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
- Grouping data using `GROUP BY`
- Filtering grouped results with `HAVING`
- Rounding numeric results using `ROUND()`

---

##  Files Included

###  `task4_aggregate_queries.sql`

- Creates the database: `task3_db`
- Creates the table: `Products`
- Inserts sample data
- Includes queries demonstrating:
  - Summing stock by category
  - Averaging prices by category
  - Counting products per category
  - Filtering grouped data using `HAVING`

---

##  Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench**
- **WAMP Server** (MySQL Server)

##  How to Run

1. Open **MySQL Workbench** and connect to your local MySQL server.
2. Open the file `task4_aggregate_queries.sql`.
3. Execute the script:
   - It will create the database and the `Products` table.
   - It will insert sample records and run aggregate queries.
4. View the summarized results in the **Result Grid**.
